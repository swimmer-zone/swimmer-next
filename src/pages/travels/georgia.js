                        <h3>Departure from Charleroi</h3>
                        <p>
                            On December 19th we took the plane from Brussels to Kutaisi, a city in Georgia. I've never thought of 
                            going to Georgia before, but the flight was pretty cheap. The plan was to combine it with Armenia, but 
                            with the current situation that didn't seem feasible. I've heard many stories about Eastern Europe 
                            being beautiful and had already had a couple of experiences myself, so that promised to be a great
                            holiday.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="kutaisi">Kutaisi</h2>
                        <p>
                            So we started off in Kutaisi where we arrived at 3am, which was the second biggest city in Georgia
                            before Batumi caught up. In Kutaisi we just spent one day and we booked one night in guesthouse Daisy's
                            Home. Daisy was a very friendly lady, she absolutely wanted us to see every room for us to pick, to
                            make it as comfortable as possible.

                        <p>
                            Because our return flight would depart from there so we would come back later. We 
                            had our first Georgian meal there, they sure like their bread and cheese. I had Khinkali, which is
                            like dumplings, but in this case with cheese filling. They have their own cheese, called Sulguni. You
                            can order a minimum of 5 Khinkali, there are other variants with mushroom, beef or potato fillings.
                            They all contain a broth, you need to bite a hole and suck out the broth. Legend goes that the person
                            that can eat the most Khinkali with spilling the least soup, must be the best kisser in town. Another
                            dish that I had was again, cheese. This time mixed up with polenta to create some sort of pancake.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Apart from some nice views, that was pretty much all we saw in Kutaisi.

                        <p>
                        The next day, on December 21st, we took a ride to Batumi, it's a coastal city with pebble beaches at 
                        the Black Sea. It is very touristy and it attracts a lot of Turks and Armenians, as it is close to 
                        the borders of those countries, that allowed it to outgrow Kutaisi and become the second largest city 
                        in Georgia. At first we went for some sightseeing along the beach promenade and downtown, where we saw 
                        the moving statue of Ali & Nino, a university building with a ferris wheel built into it what later on 
                        became a hotel, we've seen several churches, both orthodox and Catholic and a synagoge. Georgia is a 
                        mix between orthodox, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim people that live together peacefully.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Ali & Nino, The sculpture was created by famous Georgian artist and sculptor Tamar Kvesitadze. The 
                            monument has got the name of the novel "Ali and Nino" by famous Azerbaijan writer Kurban Said. The 
                            novel "Ali and Nino" tells about the tragic love story of Azerbaijan Muslim Ali Shirvashir and Georgian 
                            Christian Nino Kipiani. The events written in the book happened during the First World War in the 
                            Caucasus. The statue of Ali and Nino was created in 2010 and represents a symbol of love, despite 
                            nationality or belief.

                            The second day we went to Sarpi, even closer to the Turkish border, we went to see a waterfall, with a 
                            statue of apostle Andrew, the waterfall led to a tunnel that serves a purpose of being the path of 
                            enlightenment. Also we saw Gonio Fortress and Sarpi Rock.

                        <p>
                            Initially we booked 3 nights in Batumi, but because we didn't like Kutaisi that much, that would mean 
                            that we would have 15 days left to spend in Tbilisi. That's why we decided to book another 3 nights 
                            in Batumi, it also seemed like a nice place to spend Christmas. There are both the Catholic and Orthodox 
                            religions in Georgia, but Christmas is celebrated on January 7th. They do celebrate New Years Eve 
                            at December 31th, but on January 14th they also celebrate Old New Year. One day of Christmas we decided 
                            to stay in and create our own meal based on Georgian ingredients. They pickle a lot of things and 
                            pomegranates are used in a variety of recipes. Of course there had to be cheese.

                            The second day of Christmas we wanted to go to the Botanical garden, we wanted to do that before, but 
                            there was a lot of rain. We spent an hour in the bus and two hours of walking, only to find out that 
                            the garden was closed. We were allowed to visit the beach, but there was trash literally everywhere.
                        </p>

                            After that we went to several pubs, they have a lot of artisan beers here, among which a tomato beer. 
                            My expectations were a bit too high, because to me it tasted like tomato juice with beer added. Same 
                            for all other types of fruity beer. So then we came to discover chacha, a byproduct of the way they 
                            make their wine in Georgia. I will elaborate on that in the Tbilisi chapter. There is plain chacha, 
                            chacha aged in oak and tarragon, peach and honey are also very popular. There are a lot of other
                            flavours as well, like four chilies, chily-berry, garlic, ginger, orange-cloves, kiwi, anything you
                            can think of. They put chacha with those ingredients in a big jar and let it age for a while. The
                            ones that I found most interesting and also liked most were the chily one and the garlic one.

                            We stayed in Royal Orbi Hotel and for the second booking we needed to move from tower A to tower C. It 
                            was a very weird experience, every tower had it's own reception, but for our booking we needed to go 
                            to a reception on the floor itself, which was setup pretty sketchy in a hotel room. For the second 
                            booking there wasn't even a reception, we arrived on time for our appointment, but the owner wasn't 
                            there and he decided to call us after midnight, when we were going out downtown, to collect his money. 
                            When we arrived back in the hotel, he was waiting for us in the lobby to collect his cash. After
                            payment, we went upstairs and our keycard appeared to be disabled. We could resolve the issue, but
                            this was our first encounter with the weird Georgian customs. Both rooms looked the same (just
                            mirrored), but one had a fridge and a hairdryer, the other had a washing machine and a microwave.
                            Georgians seem very fond of toilet paper was only one role present, we had to go to the reception
                            on each next day to pickup a new one and these weren't the last bookings where this was a thing.

                        <p>
                            On December 27th we took the train to Tbilisi, where we arrived in the weirdest hostel ever, called 
                            "Modely". The room was empty with only 2 camping beds with the mattresses covered in plastic, I
                            think we should have been glad they were, to have some sense of hygiene. A weird contraption should
                            have functioned as a shelving unit. If you put something on, it would collapse. The shower had only
                            cold water, there was no toilet paper and the lobby was used for the owner to chill out with his
                            friends.
                        </p>

                            This didn't feel right at all, so we decided to pay for the night and leave right away. We came across
                            a guesthouse "Tents in Georgia", which was infinitely better. We slept in a tent inside the house,
                            which was quite a nice concept. THe owner was very friendly and helpful and we ended up in a pubcrawl
                            with them and other guests and people who live there.

                            The first full day we were in Tbilisi we booked a free tour through the city with David. He told us
                            about Liberty Square, Europe Square, the Mother of Georgia statue on the top of the mountain. The
                            Freedom Bridge, the Tamada statue and introduced us to the sulfur baths which are supposed to have
                            healing capabilities. We gladly took those the next day. It is believed that it will bring intelligence
                            if you rub the head of the Tamada statue, to bring prosperity if you rub his glass or to bring fertility
                            if you rub his lap. If you sit on his lap you will be rewarded with all three.

                        <p>
                            We planned a day trip to Armenia, the original plan was to visit both countries and spend an equal
                            amount of time in both Georgia and Armenia by flying from Tbilisi to Yerevan. But because there was
                            some stuff going on between Azerbaijan and Armenia, we decided to stick to Georgia and do a day trip
                            to some border villages in Armenia. This appeared to be a big adventure, because it's close to New
                            Years Day and this was the time families get united.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We visited three monasteries which all were located on top of mountains and offered great views. It was
                            also near a copper factory which was still in use. We also went to a ghost town, the cable cars where
                            still dangling in the air as it stopped mid-service. I believe that was because war was declared. Both
                            Georgia and Armenia have been in wars a lot because of their strategical position, Silk Road goes
                            right through them. Tbilisi is also very rough, because every time they built anything up again, some
                            new war is declared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also went to a family guest house, to have a typical Armenian lunch. The coffee is very similar to
                            Turkish coffee and of course we had some booze, we could choose between wine and brandy. Back on the
                            road we walked into a guy who had a market stand with souvenirs, but he also distilled his own chacha.
                            Of course he didn't let us leave before we tasted some of his produce.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trip was a big adventure, on the border towards Armenia we were warned that it could take a while
                            to get back to Georgia and she pointed to the line. On the way back the line seemed to be multiple
                            kilometers long and if we had to wait it could have taken more than 10 hours to get back. Our tour
                            guide Kat was great, because she was very knowledgeable and taught us a lot about the cultures and
                            also was great with keeping the group together. She even managed to arrange alternative transport,
                            a van that was waiting for us at the other side of the border. Without that we might even have needed
                            to wait twice as long. I feel sorry for the driver, because he only got back home the next afternoon.

                            An off day to get some rest before celebrating new year's eve. We decided to sleep late and get some
                            groceries to prepare dinner. If we woke up early we probably would have fainted half way through the
                            celebrations. We had some pomegranate wine and some more exotic drinks that we got from our trip to
                            Armenia. We watched fireworks at Freedom Square at midnight and after that we went for a pub crawl with
                            the people from the hostel. We visited several pubs and afterwards I went to a funny place with some of
                            the guys to play beer games. I really enjoyed although was really hung over afterwards.

                            Next day we took it at our own pace and decided to take the metro to the end station and slowly
                            progressed towards the hostel, station by station. We saw a market which was very busy and of course
                            a day is not complete without a Georgian meal. I tried all versions of the Khinkali: mushroom, cheese,
                            minced meat, but I liked the mushroom one the most.

                            On January 2nd we did a wine tour to Telavi and Kakheti, where we also visited the Bodbe Monastery in
                            Sighnaghi, which is also called the love city. We were welcomed at our first stop at 9:30am with a
                            wine tasting, some chacha and we got to make some churchkhela.

                            In Georgia they have their own way of wine making, which is way older than the French version. It dates
                            to 6000 years BC and it is part of the Unesco world heritage. In France they only use the grape juice,
                            but in Georgia they use the whole grape. They put it in a Kvevri clay jarunder ground where they let it
                            sit to ferment. After a while they take the juice to another jar to ripen further, leaving the residu
                            so that it can be used to distill chacha. This also leaves a residu, which is then boiled and used to
                            create churchkhela. This is made by hanging nuts on a rope and dipping it in the cooking emulsion.
                            Because it takes a very long time to go off, it was used to feed their armies. You can read a more
                            detailed version of thie wine making process
                            on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_wine">Wikipedia</a>. I even started liking white
                            wine again, the ones I liked most were the white Khikhvi and the red Saperavi. There are loads more
                            to try though.

                            We wanted to see the Chronicles of Georgia, which were located on top of a hill, just outside of the
                            city. This offered great views over the city and Tbilisi Sea and the Chronicles itself were huge. You
                            can see on the photos where there are a few people as a reference. In the evening we went to Mtatsminda
                            Park. This is an amusement park on top of a mountain right next to the city. We went up with a bus,
                            only to discover that every single attraction was closed, except for bumper carts, where we were the
                            only ones to enjoy. It did offer some nice views over Tbilisi by night, but apart from that it was
                            quite a waste of time, shame that it wasn't mentioned anywhere.

                            We did another guided tour and went to the Highlights of Kaukasus Mountains, to the Jinvali water
                            reservoir which had a castle on top. The story he told was very cool, it was about several towers
                            which acted as beacons during war. If there was a war coming, a beacon was lit, sending the message
                            to the next which was then lit and so on. It really gave a Lord of the Rings feel to it. Furthermore
                            we went to Ananuri, Gudauri. We planned to go to Kazbegi but the road was closed because there might
                            be avalanches. Georgia has a lot of micro climates, in Tbilisi it was around 15 degrees while it was
                            snowing just several kilometres north. In Batumi we experienced tropical rain. Instead of Kazbegi
                            we went to the old capital Mtskheta. Because of the very cold temperatures we experienced, it was
                            very nice to enjoy another sulfur bath afterwards.

                            Today we went on another free city tour, did some more wine and chacha tasting which obviously
                            couldn't be omitted. We were told some more about the wine traditions and the sulfur baths, it was
                            a bit hard to follow for me because the tour was mainly in Spanish. Afterwards we went to a liquor
                            store to get us some souvenirs and almost left those drunk, because we were somewhat forced to tasted
                            several of them. All of the chacha flavours are home made, I took a kiwi one and an aged one. In the
                            afternoon we went to the museum of illusions.

                            Last day, train back to Kutaisi, spent a night in Charleroi because of delays. Below are some random
                            pictures. We arrived back home at January 7th.
